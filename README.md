# Newspack Media Partners

Adds a Media Partners taxonomy. Media partners can be created and assigned to posts, and are intended for posts published in conjunction with other outlets. The media partner's logo will be automatically injected into the post content along with a "This story also appeared in [Media Partner]" message. 

This also adds a `[partners]` shortcode which will output a grid of all media partners and their logos.
